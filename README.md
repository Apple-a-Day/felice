-Looks like genre pulling will have to happen with Lastfm api since 99% of Spotify's albums are not tagged with genre. (Even thought the api endpoint exists). <br>
-Contact echonest to figure out some efficent way of calling their api <br>
-Implement require js to modularize Spotify and Echonest API calls. <br>
-Echonest jsonp calls <br>
-d3js animated pie chart <br>
-d3js time line graph <br>
