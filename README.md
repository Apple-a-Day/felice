# felice
A bunch of data for your Spotify music library <br>
Quick description of approach: <br>
Rest api written in express js, node, mongoose and a few miscellaneous libs <br>
Front end written in backbone and sass
##Installation instructions
Make sure you have mongodb installed. <br>
In one terminal window run: (if on windows make sure your mongodb directory is in you path)
```
$mongod
```
In another window, run:
```
$npm install
$npm start
```
Currently its going to start in dev mode with nodemon, so make sure you have that insstalled with the command:
```
$npm install -g nodemon
```
Otherwise just modify package.json to your liking and ask me any questions about setting it up in case I forgot something. <br>
